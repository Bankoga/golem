Name: Reward Rate Brake (Tail of VTA)
Layers: 
Cell Details: The tail is major inhibitory nucleus that possesses robust functional, and structural links to the dopamine pathways. Acts as a master brake for the mid-brain dopamine system
Tail receives inputs from Medial PFC (The DM), Cingulate, Preoptic, Lateral Hypothal (mode controller), Lateral Habenula (which is suspected to be part of the reward likelihood module), Superior Collic (i.e. the response direction indicating sub-cort map), Dorsal Raphe (serotonin system), Laterodorsal Teg (i.e. the Activant Ctrlr), SN, NAC, VenP
Tail outputs t- Serotonin, Preoptic, Mode Controller, SN, VTA, Activant Ctrl, Periaqueductal gray
(Do I need to update tail to incorporate output from the output function?)
Purpose: Linearly? down-regulates reward activity
