Name: Reward Modulator (VTA)
Layers: Custom
Cell Details: The VTA is located in the midbrain and consists of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons.[10] 

Outputs 2 types of dopamine, repeat-assoc & avoid-assoc
Purpose: Determines the Internal Output Review driven Dopamine Levels of some modules within the Output Control, Memory, and Decision pipelines
Depeletion of dopamine in the pathway to the OT, and VenP from the VTA decreases the number of actions a creature is willing to take before giving up on the current goal or reward item

Almost all areas receiving projections from the VTA project back to it. It's reciprocally connected with a wide range of structures throughtout the brange.
GABAergic inputs include NAC, VenP, Tail of VTA. Most subpallidal structures that project to the VTA are inhibitory
Gluta comes from the Activant,DM,STN,Mode Ctrl,Focus Ctrl modules (not counting recip connection so some overlap)
