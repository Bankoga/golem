# G.O.L.E.M

> Goal Oriented Logos Encapsulation Matrix

## Overview

The purpose of this framework is twofold:

- A project for me to complete on my own! I need to do this, and can't continue it for the moment. Though it'll probably already be done by the time I can get back around to it.
- A meta-description to matrix (graph of processing nodes) building system
  - What I needed to do was define the behavioural properties @ each scale
  - Like Top: load golem config, load saved golem, build golem, repl golem
  - Botttom (cells)

Fun Fact: Architecting can be largely divorced from engineering through property based automated evaluation.

The code does not matter to me.
Sort of.
Details are not my forte.
While there are details as part of broad stroke overlays (they do have to overlay points after all), many of the details are missing because they matter for implementation.
Our underlying mental substrate can just wash them away because they matter only at maximum levels of granularity.
This is typical of much of the thinking I do.
Details simply do not matter to me.
They are ancillary considerations that get in the way of understanding the big picture.
Which tis all I really care about.

That being said, the code in this case, is very near and dear to me.
I need to finish it, and I don't think it ethical for me to do so currently.
The hesitation has only partially been because of that.
My apologies for the lack of development, and the lack of proper behavioural specification.
While the archive is rather useful, I feel I forgot to write about many important things.
Furthermore, much of the work I had intended to do as refactor, isn't referenced anywhere.
Though lots of it simply has to do with pulling it all together, as opposed to finding all the pieces.
A way to think about it perhaps, is that herein lie most of the pieces to several different puzzles that produce the same picture, which were being recomposited into a new puzzle.

## Reason for cessation of development

I've been under surveillance for ~2 years.
One tends to notice an odd overlap of small fixed winged aircraft, and ones outings.
Though made more notable by a distinct lack of social life.
Tis only polite to wave!
They never wave back though, and it makes me sad.
Furthermore, tis pretty obvious when military form looking drones are used under bad weather conditions for low level flight over extensive private property directly over a walking path.
Which was fun!
I liked that.
They know I know, and I know they know.
Security through obscurity, never was.
Who listens to crazy people who think they are under surveillance though?

Part of the reason why it's taken me so long to actually get here is because for the first year, I was really hoping the spoopers would steal this from me.
Tis too awesome to not steal.

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Right.

THIS CODE BASE WAS ENTIRELY NOT THE POINT!
THIS IS A PRE-PROJECT SO THAT I COULD DO THE REAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE PROJECT!

I try to avoid stupidity.
A stupid thing, is one that is fundamentally incapable of solving some problem given an unbounded amount of time.
Modern machine learning neural network description techniques, are stupid.
If not, they simply make it too difficult for ME, to reason about neural networks.

I'm trying to describe large distributions of non-heterogenous things in a way I can understand at a glance.
All said things locally evolve too!
Yes.
Tis unfortunate that I can't glance at the entire thing at once.
Tis large.
Oh my goodness.
That's what representations across scales really helps with.

Describing things with math, is about leaving out most of the logic because it doesn't matter for a broad, and detailed pictures.
Perhaps fractally detailed.
Fractally detailing something that isn't fractal however, makes no sense to me.
I despise modern machine learning descriptions.
Math is part of the solution...
The "elegance", of mathematics, gets in the way of understanding.
For some, a mathematical representation is most useful.
For most, tis not the case.
Regardless, either will be convertible into the other.
There is no need, for The ONE!
Fools.

This was trivially identified two years ago.
So instantly started doing something that wasn't modern machine learning
At some point in 2018,, I went through the fastai course, which is lovely, and did enjoy modern machine learning.
However, I immediately gave up on it, and went back to what I had thought needed to be done originally.
Academia has blinded itself.
To be fair, any one, like deep mind, who internally embed hostile culture, aren't interested in human problem solving.
I'm sort of fucking mad at those ass holes, who should have done this two years ago.
They fucking solved for Go.
They should have been the ones to do this.
They didn't because of all the issues I've pointed out in Catch-22, which now lives on inside Bankogas Philosophy repo.
What is here will remain, but will no longer be touched.
