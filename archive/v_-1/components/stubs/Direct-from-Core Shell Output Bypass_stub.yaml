Name: Direct-from-Core Shell Output Bypass
Layers: Coder
Cell Details: Dedicated Functions that can act as Nodes. They are not acting as cells though
Purpose: To serve as the muscle/motor the system executes. A way to return strings directly to some destination N characters at a time
For now though, it will also be used to proxy an intrinsic reward using a Node function instead of Node cells. Semantically corresponds to an objective function in other ML lit.
Generates reward loss information based on output that it sends to ?????????
