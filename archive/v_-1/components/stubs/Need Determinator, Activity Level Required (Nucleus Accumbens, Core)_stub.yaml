Name: Need Determinator, Activity Level Required (Nucleus Accumbens, Core)
Layers: Custom
Cell Details: Composed mostly (95%) of Medium Spiny Neurons split ~evenly between Type-1, and Type-2 Dopamine receptors, and compared to the neurons in the Shell have an increased density of dendritic spines, branch segments, and terminal segments. GABA receptors are also abundant among the MSns of the NAcc
There is evidence that in the NACs Type-1 mediates pos assoc (i.e. reward/increased dopamine) related, and Type-2 mediates neg assoc (i.e. avoidance)
2% are aspiny cholinergic interneurons (for mode bottom-up, or top-down activity control)
2% are GABAergic interneurons
Purpose: Determines the activity level required in the various sub-regions, and projects Inhibitors to the passive output control inhibitors (SNpr, GPi,VenP)
