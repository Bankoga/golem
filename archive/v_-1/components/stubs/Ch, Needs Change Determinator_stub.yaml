Name: Ch, Needs Change Determinator
Layers: N
Cell Details: -----
Purpose: Can enhance or reduce the rate of need driven activity through each Need Determinaton, in direction and/orstrength.
So a different output channel for the unique joint list across each need determinator modules output melds
Pipeline: N
Input Melds: base
+ previous rates
Input Semantic Field Sizes (Key:Shape): base/base_fract
+ previous/n_fract
Internal Melds (wht bt fld mpngs?): Need Change Circuit
Output Melds: Energy->Need Determinator, Directions of Need Pos need + Need Determinator, Activity Level of Pos Need
Energy->Need Determinator, Directions of Need Neg need + Need Determinator, Activity Level of Neg Need
Output Semantic Field Sizes: base
Circuits it Defines: Needs Change
Misc Circuits it uses: N
Input Circuits: Input Meld
Output Circuits: Output Meld
Channels: Ch, Needs Change Determinator
