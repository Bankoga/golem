Name: Need Mediator (Olfactory Tubercule)
Layers: Custom
Cell Details: Major Outputs
VenP
Tail of VTA (i.e. Inhib channel or layer)
SN
Reticular formation of the Pons (which is made of three parts so it's to one or more of the 3: raphe nuclei (median), gigantocellular reticular nuclei (medial zone), and parvocellular reticular nuclei (lateral zone).)

Same composition as VenP, and Putamen/CadN
Purpose: Major glutamergic inputs are from the following
PFC (particulary prelimbic, and infralimbic which correspond to specific DM channels),
basolateral amygdala
ventral hippocampus
thalamic nuclei (midline, and intralaminar)
and glutamergic from the VTA
