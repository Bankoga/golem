# G.O.L.E.M: The myth, the package, the legend

G.O.L.E.M: Goal oriented, logic encapsulation matrix. A noble endeavor for the logic minded.
This package is for building, deploying, and maintaining golems.

## Overview

### Golem Components

- Core
- Framework
- Regulator
- Shell

These pieces are composed of modules, circuits, pathways, & networks. All combined, they form the primary processing matrix of a Golem. Processing matrix specific documentation are stored in the corresponding matrix readmes. Any discussion of the processing matrix herein is tailored to the construction of a golem from packages, and their wiring. (Is wiring a separate package type?).

Each component type section consists of the following:

- a definition
- an explication of purpose
- an overview of types/sub-types
- ?

What are _BLANK_?
What purpose do _BLANK_ serve?
How are _BLANK_ useful/what are the benefits of this paradigm?
How are _BLANK_ detrimental/what are the drawbacks of this paradigm?

## Core

> Definition: The primary processing system of a golem. i.e. the seat of intelligence. Can only have 1 per golem, and can be paired.

### Purpose of the Core

Determines the types of logos encapsulation a golem can perform. The Core determines the extent to which a golem can adapt, learn, or remember. Semantic processing, world modeling, relational reasoning, agent capabilities, multi-modal support or aggregation, location mapping, etc... are all aspects of a golems primary purpose.

### Types of Cores

## Framework

> Definition: The construction, deployment, and maintenance systems of a golem. Can only have 1 per golem, and can be paired.

### Purpose of the Framework

The framework handles all primary routing inbetween all model type modules (regardless of location, and model type module is structurally analogous to some part of the neocortex), I/O regulation & modulation, association, and fine-tuning. It also determines dynamic shell reconfiguration capabilities, and the output selection controller.

### Types of Frameworks

## Regulator

> Definition: The modulation, and directly supported metaoperation capabilities of the golem. Can only have 1 per golem. Certain parts can't be paired.

### Purpose of the Regulator

There are a lot of matrix wide support operations required to have a functioning golem. Interactivity between the golem matrix, and operators is vital for a large number of operations. Thus mechanisms for feedback, and matrix-wide property modulation are necessary. All feedback, as well as the primary drives/goals, reside herein. A golems regulator determines the types of feedback (neg/pos/both i.e. pain/pleasure) it can receive, and, in some instances, generates part, or most, of the golems feedback internally.

### Types of Regulators

## Shell

> Definition: The housing, and I/O systems of a golem. A golem only has an aggregate shell which can be composed of many different distinct, or interconnected sub-shells. Can be paired. They are like microservices, or plugins.

### Purpose of the Shell

The interactive bits. Data processing models for entry into/manipulation by the core. A motor controller, and corresponding motor are part of the same shell, with the controller being a model that gets hooked into the golem for construction deployment, and maintenance, and the motor being well defined mapping between commands and external actions. An eye or pair of eyes is a shell. Having a pair of eyes in one place, then another pair somewhere else would require adding two distinct eye shells to the golem.
Paired vs individual shell support is determined by the Core and Framework types. Imagine having a stationary mainframe body with potential avatar bodies, and a mobile body without potential avatars. The various modeling systems within the core would thus determine what types of inputs a golem can support, how many of each type, how they get aggregated into semantic wholes, the numbers, and sizes of item location maps, the info compression rate from shell to core, and many other critical elements.

### Shell Types

- Primary : A distinct shell or set of integrated shells that form a complete input, and/or output suite/set
  - These should define/present a unified input, and/or output set for consumption by the Shell aggregator modules
  - Primary Shells: The type of shell that produces an input set for integration into the Golem, and each coherent external map (i.e. things like a specific body location map set (sensors + processors + motors + combined) input/output set). It can be stand-alone or serve to integrate an arbitrary number of cross-compatible partial shells
- Secondary : A shell that is integrated as part of some other input, and/or output suite/set
  - The type of shell that must be integrated into a container shell in order to properly function

Metaoperation & Internal Sensorimotor shells integrate into one shell

## Connectivity

Greater details on matrix edges are stored in the relevant matrix readme files.

What connects the pieces?
How is data passed around?
How does each cell know where to project resources, and where to look for resources?
How do we avoid dependency hell when trying to select different packages to use when building, or maintaining a golem?

Types of Edge Definitions

- Circuits : Layer to layer edge mappings that generate a directly linked specific types of cell within each layers destinations
- Pathways : Direct module to module edges
- ? : ?

### Golem Types

This seems like it would consists of all pre-existing golem evolution/(creation||generation) lines which are known, with or without any further documentation on them.
