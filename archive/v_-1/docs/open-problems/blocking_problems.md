# Blockers

Problems that prevent completion of the framework!

## Framework Project

- External I/O
  - num encoder, and decoder methods
  - receptive fields for encoder domains
  - how to get meaningful output from a graph
- ~~Stitching~~
  - how to connect two problem domains together when they aren't adjacent.
    - how to choose destinations for output axons within a region/problem domain
    - for now we are going to proceed with the fractional split until we encounter a reason to use a different type
- Config
  - details
  - format
- Neuromodulation
  - different types of chemicals, and their effects
  - how to consume chemicals
  - how to apply effects to cells

What I really want to do, is have an architecture ready to go, build the configs for the architecture, and then implement the needed pieces of the framework with a real example. So why don't I just do it in that order?
