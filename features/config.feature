  # However, better BDD practice is to use declarative steps.
  # This allows greater code reuse in the automation code.
  # Gherkin-based automation frameworks *can* be used for unit testing.
  # However, they are better suited for integration and end-to-end testing.
  # This feature file does unit testing for the sake of illustrating Gherkin usage.
