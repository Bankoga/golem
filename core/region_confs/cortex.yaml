# this is object type for region configs that is inherited by each type of region
# contains all the data needed to initialized a new region for a problem domain given the specific input/output constraints of the PD
#     - destination/connection data
#         - layer to layer connections
#         - substitution spots for cross-PD connections
#         - region to regions connections
#     - cell types for each layer
#     - plasticity data (if differs from generic)
#     - resource constraints (if differs from generic)
# it is perhaps the case that l1-6 naming convention works fine normally, something more descriptive may be nice
# What should be used as the destination between semantically named layers? The order? What about cross-region references?
# The destinations should use the path data schema with appropriate substitution slots, and relative paths
