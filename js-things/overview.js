// Thoughts on the overall interconnected structure of the system
// Everything has a size, computational complexity, activation cost, notification sentry, and agent interaction hook
// cells implement the P2P connected distributed processing system which everything else uses
// cells also can implement ad hoc network for different types of connections between ologs and objects
// ologs implement the category system and are primarily represented by relay cells
// areas implement the default processing networks, and top level configuration
// areas

Connections
- these are the types of cells that represent different different functions or transformations of threads

Threads
- in order to support multiple concurrent cognitive tasks (foreground, and background) we need a default threading system for node processing


Agent
- wasersteinn CGAN that can control the output of the underlying database system
- it is the database builder
- it is the connection builder

what does the agent do?
- leverages the system to
-- build frames
-- attach semantic chains to frames
-- review success of system components in fulfilling objectives
-- review success of responses to stimuli
-- add new Categories, connections, or connections types (transformation functions between cells and/or ologs)
-- modify existing weights of connections
