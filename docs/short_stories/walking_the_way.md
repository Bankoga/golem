Burned by the hypocrisy of Society
Having become a hypocrite myself
What is The Way I wondered
So I wandered
Down millions of paths have I walked
Lifetimes spent on ageless roads
Lifeless aeons lost in tenebrous dark
Glimly lit gloom that grew darker and darker
For each way I wandered
Each way littered with uncountable things
Each thing did I count
Only to find it was not The Way
It was not The Way
Every day
A new way
Faster
Faster Faster
I sought in vain
Way after Way did I throw away
All hopes of finding
Any sign of The Way
Only when I had nowhere left to wowander
When all had been lost
Freedom was found
My Way revealed
For My Way is not The Way
Even though it is
Now in the dark I wander
No longer alone
For I am on my way
Wherever

I am
```
