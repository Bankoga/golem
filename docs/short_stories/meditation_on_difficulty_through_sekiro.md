# Meditation on Difficulty through Sekiro

> **TL;DR**: Difficulty is relative to current capability! Uniform fit solutions do not exist for sufficiently complicated subjects! Sekiro is awesome with issues!

There are two aspects to this, a mechanical and philosophical.

For most of my life, I’ve very much approached games in a pseudo-completionist way. That meant ticking all the quest boxes (that weren’t simply massive collect the feather quests unless they gave me super awesome things that I more or less “needed”. They were necessary I assure you.) and completing the game. Beating the game, was after all, the point of the buying the game. If the point of the game was to be beaten. The idea that having fun was decoupled from the idea of beating the game really only occurred to me recently. I am a moron after all. There are so many counter points to that idea in terms of simply games designed alone, but it wasn’t an explicit idea. It was something I hadn’t really been paying attention to in the way I behaved that led to it. It was a symptom, not really a cause in and of itself. Memorizing symptom management methods is a poor solution. Which is another fun point in and of itself that Sekiro is forcing me to relearn by the way I’m playing. Which is while meditating without mind.

Games were fun. RPG video games in particular drew me in because of the stories. Adventure games such as the Ocarina of Time for their exploration. Though I’ve greatly enjoyed combat games, nothing has ever really done combat right, this is a particular science fantasy notion of video game rightness. Though the core element is abstractable to larger categories of games. As martial arts enthusiast (YAY!), I’m picky about my combat. In part, because video games where action, and intended playstyle, and story intersect have historically caused lots of video game developer horse shit. Empty railings that can’t be shot through, locked doors that can’t be broken…, locks that can’t be broken…, I’m sorry I’ll go on for a while about not being able to break things. More examples, player and npc move set parity, arbitrary climbing points, and so on. This is because of the biggest issue, which is the most difficult to fix.

Video games tend to eschew mechanical equality of treatment of all things in the game world. All actions, and objects being subject to the same underlying rule set. Video combat, by and large, breaks this really hard. The tailor made solutions to highly chaotic problems that are not well understood (because we made them ourselves and have very little data) tend to be poorly fitted.

This is not the NPC behavior issue which is either a symptom of the same or underlying issue depending on formulation because things aren’t bottom up. However, there is an ethical upper limit on the granularity of simulations of certain complexity used with minimal rights. Ancestor simulations, I highly suspect to be intrinsically unethical. To some extent, that is a consequence of not being able to imagine how they are necessary as opposed to simply greedy.

Dark Souls, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, The Witcher 3 all have elements of it. More recent games are starting to address the issue. However, there are three games worth mentioning that take this seriously one of which is borked, For Honor, Sekiro, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. For Honor was borked by corporate greed. They did the footwork to have an interesting take on combat without following through on that paradigm in a modular way. Of the two remaining, both have issues, and neither one handles difficulty well.

FUN FACT: I loved how Dragons Dogma obviously uses the same mechanics (and I would really hope it’s because enging things) as Monster Hunter. Introducing a paradigm with one game of lower base difficulty, then ramping up the base difficulty for a follow up game (mechanically descended) sounds like a great way to respect ones consumers.

This is brings us to difficulty though. Which is relative to my current capabilities. Sekiro doesn’t need an easy mode. The idea of EASY is the problem. One persons easy, is another persons hard. Tweaking health and damager do not solve the combat problem. So many games make this mistake. Games I love and have spent so many hours playing. The two biggest in my mind are Borderland 2, and Skyrim. Though I perhaps played Mod Manager 20XX way more than I played Skyrim, or Modrym, I still logged a lot of skyrim hours. Both games do not respect the idea of difficulty. Which is that everything is fundamentally fair, and skill is the only thing that matters. Tweaking and health damage, breaks this. Life isn’t fair in terms of vitality, and games reflect that. Which makes sense. That’s not the issue. The issue is when global changes are made because compositionally, the combat system is broken. It doesn’t work as a representation. It requires extra imagination to work as a representation. This is fine for many types of games like turn based games! This is not acceptable for compositonal combat based games. Compositonal is akin to dynamic in some sense.

Sekiro, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R both get that. What they don’t get is what martial arts schools get, and that some people are beginners, and some people are experts. This is about speed of dynamics. The particular dynamics themselves, do not matter.

What they do get though, is that this is a journey. This brings us to the directly mentioned philosophical point, though many are encoded: The ideology of beating something as success, I now understand, isn’t the point. It misses the point of life entirely. Life is a process. It is a journey. The destination of life, is death. Being born, ethically probably means dying at some point. Longevity, does not trend towards unethicality. It simply is. Immortality however, seems to trend towards being unethical. I’m not sure it’s intrinsically unethical, it may very well be though. Living for a billion years, or extending ones life to that point, can be perfectly ethical. The journey of that billion years determines its ethicality. Not the length of the journey, and every instant of the journey. I’ve had S.T.A.L.K.E.R. for several years now and have never beaten it. This used to bother me, and now it doesn’t. Though I would like to finish the game at some point. I’ve spent too much time squirreling away ammo and weapons in tons of stockpiles. I’m bad at shooters though. It is so much worse about that than Skyrim, and I loved it. On the one hand, loot management can be annoying as all hell, and on the other, it really makes me think. Being forced to think is a good thing. We don’t do enough of it. This another thing that both Sekiro and S.T.A.L.K.E.R force me to do when I stop treating them as destinations, and instead as journies. Yes they need to address the difficulty issue, and no it’s not about an easy mode. The idea of easy mode, is in and of itself, a symptom of deeper ideological issues. Most people live their lives trying to avoid thinking it seems to me. I’m not really any different. Such is the comfort of habit, and routine. They don’t require “thinking”. This is a particularly harmful notion that is symptomatic of the issues with how historically intelligence has been considered.

While I may never beat Sekiro from what I’ve heard about the final boss fight, that’s okay with me now. As a work of art it would be fine to not ever touch the game again for gameplay things outside of bug fixes. However, this is a corporate video game product. Whether or not art should be accessible, is not question I’m considering here, and I don’t know the answer either. Furthermore, whether corporation are capable of art is not. While it does some like corporate art is possible, Sekiro doesn’t apply. It’s for profit. Art fundamentally to expression, and understanding. That’s not all that art is, but it is at the heart of art. In conjunction, I understand craft as art done for profit. Crafting transforms someone elses intent through the artisans intent. Art can be done for others, but it is not intent in the art. This is probably violable in some way, though at the same time speaks to me very strongly about what art is, in and of itself. A really good artist can probably do art for profit without it turning into craft. They are the same thing, even though they aren’t.

Now, one way to solve the progression issue would be to have the bosses be all assassinatable like most predominantly stealth based games. This is an area where games don’t follow through, and Sekiro the same mistakes as all the other games. That being said, it’s a difficult thing. That fundamentally changes the game, and potentially adds tons of extra work for what actual degree of return on investment? I don’t know. That’s the question that any profit-maximizing entity makes. This isn’t at capitalism vs socialism. No no. Both are evil. It is simply a consequence of the symptom that is capitalism. To make Sekiro a more accessible game would probably have driven their bottom line up. If people could play through as a super badass combat ninja, or a super badass stealthy ninja then in my mind it would have more market share. Though again, if it’s a work of art though, then it doesn’t care. I’m not gonna speak to creator intent, only function of impact on me. To that end, I am very grateful that I have games that can help force me to push beyond my mental boundaries, and it would be nice if we could collectively find bounded tractable paths through an otherwise untractable domain.

Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed, or at least were not unduly discomfited; I am an asshole after all.

NOTE: I’m only ~30 hour into Sekiro, and haven’t made it past the boss in the valley. It’s a great practice boss so I’m using it for that instead of trying to memorize, and push through. Memorization is not understanding. Through memorization, it is possible to approximate that which one does not understand. It is not a replication produced from understanding though and is consequently less transferable. Transfer machine learning is pretty funny in that sense then haha.
