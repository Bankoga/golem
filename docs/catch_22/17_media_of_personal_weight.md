[Series Overview](https://medium.com/@bankoga/catch-22-overview-of-an-anthological-pedestal-66458dfb5c1d)

First things first, all media changes me. This is about deeper change. Things that either catalyzed, or caused deep experiences. Again broader than perhaps is oft inteded with said query. Though to some extent, this could simply be a list of things I can actually remember, because of habits that have developed, I've accrued a large body of cached data, and links. The list of things I remember that changed me or have bookmarked is far larger than this list. This list goes over important things. Some of the stuff I've consider worth saving, was done in anticipation of reading, or to serve as a reminder that I had at least started. I can stomach a lot to get at what some one is trying to do if they do not seem to be malign in their intentions with whatever it is I find questionable... Sometimes anyway. Funnily, I would say more impactful things now than I used to. In part because I've grown a lot better at identifying what I think I need for remembering from something, while backgrounding the rest. So much has useful tiddly bits.

An export of my bookmarks from the date this file was created lives in the repo. I've not bothered to groom them. Over the years, I've developed many patterns of behavior to cope with the expectations of society, and mostly for personal reasons. Fuck Society. Hello Old Me. At any rate, bookmarking and digital annotation are of great interest to me so I've build a body of bookmarks. Several thousand of them. All of which I've read. Sort of. There are a few hundered more in need of addition through a clipping to bookmark process I go through to save articles outside of WALLED GARDENS! Every digital garden is walled... There are 4500-5000 bookmarks in the repo. In various states of organization... Tis not something I do very well if it is not absolutely necessary. Funnily, this has been part of a very very long term plan for a wiki building system. Something I've wanted since childhood actually. There are plenty of things I've not bothered to save. I am highly variable at times...

They can't kill death. Unless he's not death. Then who the fuck is this imposter, and how did dey gauntlet?), shit happens, life is better(ish))

Fun Fact: I once lost a Minnox camera for over 5 years inside a pocket on an underjumpsuit thing for space travler likes.

## Comics

- Shin Angyo Onshi (part of me would scream at you to read this. I'm not sure if I agree with that. A huge part of me would say though, if nothing else, read this. I don't know. There is a specific point, that catalyzed profound sense of dawning understanding for me. )
- V for Vendetta
- Threads of Time/살례탑 (this is something I spent a while last year refinding, and rereading. Funnily, I don't reread a lot of stuff. The Valdemar series I've reread a fair amount.)

## Books

When I was in kindergartgen, I was almost held back for a year because I refused to read. Only because of a wonderful elementary school teacher who tutored me over the summer did I begin to enjoy reading. Afterwards I had a voracious apetite, and read many things. Mostly fantasy though because I'm sensitive to things. Once I got to college though, my reading became light. I've stuck mostly to articles since then but binge on books every now and again.

- Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar Series (All books through ~2009 because I didn't realize they were still being published...)
- Discworld Series
- A vast swathe of the Tarzan series. There are so many of them...
- There are lots of educational content that does fall in here like The Giver, Lord of the Flies, Silverstein poetry, The Jungle
- There are a fair amount of educational books that for me, were not worth experiencing. The same information is better gained through different stories. Like Great Expectations (which I despised). Two minds will not get the same things out of the same books. What I consider important to me, may have no impact on you. In fact, it could even be harmful!
- Godel, Escher, Bach (which was partially muted for me because of an Awesome computer science theory class that presented the content phenomenally. So I was already aware of it. Somethings cannot be unheard. This does change an experience, though perhaps not as it is commonly talked about. Regardless, the final lecture was mind blowing, and altered my life forever. GEB covers the same content in a different along with a bunch of connected topics.)
- World War Z
- The Black Company Series
- Drizzt Do'Urden Series
- Mistborn Trilogy
- Heart of Darkness (While I felt it was all pretty obvious when I read it, the nature of it can make it hard to stomach. Context must be always considered. Life comes from shit. After all.)
- I, Robot (perhaps the 3 laws are not what they smell like)
- There's probably stuff I'm missing.
- Oh. Outside of the Silmarillion
- Harry Potter Series
- Harry Potter and the methods of rationality

The media that you need in order to develop however you want to develop, varies. Recreating the past to recreate another is a mistake. It depends...
