Catch-22: True vs False, and Truthy-Falsy

> **TL;DR**: 

Series Overview: https://medium.com/@bankoga/catch-22-overview-of-an-anthological-pedestal-66458dfb5c1d

## True vs False

True is not False. False is not True. We hold these things to be self-evident. Opposites are they! Each defined by the other.

A True thing is. Lies are Truths

There is no one Truth. There is only Truth.

A False thing is not. Truths are Lies

from human_history.logic.proofs import undefinability_theorem

The Truth of a perspective or universe is inaccessible from within any instance of aforementiond type of complexity greater or equal to that represented by the perspective or universe of eternal basic arithmetic.

However, what about paradox?
This statement is False! Tis not True! Tis not False!

## Truthy Falsy

Thus we see, truthy-falsy.
A paradox is True when one approaches from a particular direction.
A paradox is False when one approaches from the opposite direction of the particular direction. The paired direction.
A truthy-falsy thing, is a dual thing. A thing is dual when there are at least two equally valid, and superficially contradictory positions on the thing.

This brings us to the notion of hard and soft conflict.
Hard conflicts do not iron out regardless of change in perspective. No matter the formulation, the underlying issue remains.
Soft conflicts disappear when one digs far enough. Much conflict results from deliberate misinterpretation of soft conflict as hard conflict because my way is the way. It's totally okay to limit the choices that others make without their consent if it is risky, so sayeth the Societies. They could make, the wrong choice after all.

## On Logic and Math

Logic is the parent. Math is the child. In this case though, we talk of entities that are universes. Cohesive sets of everything. Math is thus subsumed by logic; a pure, and proper subset tis it. The power of math, comes from the power of logic. Though many mathematicians I find, like to assert otherwise. 
As a bit of an aside, Academia on the whole, is built on fundamentally foul ideological principles. The ideal is not! We are not ideals! There is an ideal Academia! We are not it, and our cultures of academia, are foul. Academics by and large are not. They are however, a part of the problem. Most of societey, including myself, parasitic feeders on the blood, sweat, and tears of academics, are also part of the problem. The system itself is corrupt. Humanity has no civilizations left. They were all murdered off by their more abusive neighbors.

## On Logic and Reason

Logic precedes reason. Illogical is not something I can determine. What is or is not logical, is beyond human capacity to determine. Only through logic, can we do so. Reason relies on logic. Logic does not rely on reason. It would seem, that logic itself tells us what is or is not logical. Only by listening to it, can we proceed.

## On Logic and Science

If I were to take away logic from the scientist, they would be rendered impotent. Unable to speak, hear, breath, think, see, move, feel, touch, or even exist. So it would seem anyway. There is a caveat to this. Which brings us to the next topic.

## On Logic and Faith

Whereby Logic and Faith intersect. There is tension here. For good reason. There is large overlap in the sets of things called religions and the sets of things non-sensically unfalsifiable

## Logic is supernatural

If Logic can describe the truth of all things in Nature outside of itself, and we have nothing that can describe logic outside of logic, then logic is greater than nature. If we can describe logic, then perhaps it is because we physically embody logic. As opposed to us being supernatural, it is logic that is supernatural. This adds nothing mechanically to our theories of reality while simultaneously introducing an a priori solution to the problem of existence. It doesn't require extra physics for logic to be supernatural and explain for existance. It requires more a priori logic work to close the gap between the data we have, and the underpinnings that necessarily cause it. If logic is sufficient for reality, then this is doable. A bridge between religion, and science exists. Without invalidating either. Our understanding of both would change though. It would in part, drop the floor out from historical and modern reasoning. We do not determine reality, and our world views are not reality. They are objective-subjective yes. If we all exist collectively as different universal probability chains, then the subjective is itself objective. At every level of reality.

## On Nonsense and Unfalsifiability

Nonsense is often false. Nonsense is often unfalsifiable though. If you do not jump up and down three times upon reading this statement, Nargolethep the demon if inattentiveness, will consume your ghurdy. This is a nonsensically unfalsifiable statement. Well it can be trivially made into it anyway. Some ideas however can be disproven while being if true, both unprovable, and unfalsifiable. The idea of logic as supernatural falls into this category of ideas. Which is distinct from both pre-hypothesis ideas, and hypotheses. It can thus never be a theorem. If there is something in nature that cannot be understood through logic, then nature is greater than logic. We have to search further still for the tools we need to answer the simple questions of existence. Not the compounded ones. In my experience though, we have nothing that cannot be understood through the power of logic.

## Yadda Yadda Meaning

Logic is not a human construct. Meaning preceedes humans. We don't invent meaning, we leverage preexisting meaning. A beloved asshat said it most brilliantly, "We are Pans Narrans". We lie, and through our lies, do we tell truths. Everything that could be, already exists. We discover, we do not invent. Fundamentally, meaning has to do with mechanical represenation of different kinds of things. Humans are intrinsically semantic. We have intrinsic meaning, and are intrinsically meaningful. Everything in life has meaning, it has so much meaning though, that it appears as if it has no meaning. Nothing does appear to be everything, quite literally, but that is a conversation for another anthology.
