Catch-22: Some Thoughts on General Intelligence

Welcome ephemeral arrangements of cosmic grain one and all!

**BACKGROUND**

When it comes to trying to understand general intelligence in humans, to see if it is possible to replicate in software, there are several questions that need to be answered. Some of the relevant primary questions that needs to be answered are as follows:

* What is consciousness?
  * Is consciousness "a thing that there is to be like that entity", or is it modern human level self awareness, with lots of "I"?
* What is intelligence?
  * Is it simply problem solving, or is it meta-problem solving necessary?
  * What is problem solving?
* Is organic chemistry necessary for intelligence?
* Is organic chemistry necessary for life? If so, is life required for intelligence?
* Regardless, is life required for intelligence?
* What is the minimum number of neurons required for a human to be generally intelligent?

Given that all doubts as to the immediate possibility of machine general intelligence have long since been removed by the works of others in my mind
And that the only caveat is the potential necessity of organic chemistry to consciousness, life, or intelligence
And thus I have zero expectation of failure in logical feasibility of the current approach (not backprop...)
When solving for something one thinks if of sufficient impact
And everyone else thinks is of sufficient impact
And is indeed going to be of sufficient impact in the minuscule possibility of success
Then it is necessary to seriously attempt to converse about it even if in the most likely case that I fail, I will simply be laughed at, called a fool, and in case of virality, quite publicly

**PURPOSE**

I'm taking a fully TDD approach to building an ethical platform for running human level self awareness entities (which I think will require less than 1 Billion neurons).
Why do I think that it will take less than a billion neurons?

The cerebellum isn't necessary for general intelligence:

Both hemispheres are not necessary for general intelligence (I suspect that the two hemisphere setup is the origin of the notion of the GAN and is in fact also a GAN):

Those two facts combined let us go from ~100 B neurons to ~10 B neurons as the minimum upper bound on the minimum number of neurons required for general intelligence. Holy batneurons batman! 8 B nodes means so many edges! That's larger than all of facebooks actual members! Not their secret graphs though.....

While squished brains are very interesting, they don't offer as much conclusive easy data as missing brain pieces. Funnily, we like talk about humans as if we come from a standardized mold, when we are in fact, turing machines... That sounds like something I've heard but I really have no clue. Nothing at all about halting, or input acceptance. Nope.

Fun Fact: Security through obscurity, never was.
Fun Fact: The mistake comes from the power of illusions.
Fun Fact: There IS power in illusions!

Now now, any claims that machine based general intelligence is possible without an already running machine general intelligence, will invariably run afoul on claims of organic chemistry necessity for intelligence, and life, and many other things. Irrecoverably so.
The only way to get anyone to believe that general intelligence can be done right now, is to do it right now...

By all means, if you find the overall subject interesting, please check out the readme for the repo which is intended for general consumption. It is by and large not technical in nature, though a smattering of technical details are mentioned initially. Though I apologize in advance for it's hoityness, as I've not redone it, because I have next to no anticipation of being taken seriously.
If you find it funny, or think there are interesting things to discuss about the concepts in the readme, or the dev practices I've been using, like Unit Test Class Inheritance, please feel free to PM me. Though it's been so long since I've needed to check my email, that I've fallen horrendously out of practice.
Unemployment for total focus on solving for general intelligence even though I'm probably going to fail is the best!

Fun Fact: As of writing 2019-04-09 dev has 951 passing, 1 failing, and 141 error throwing test methods!

These docs are what helped spawn the framework approach, which you'll have to dig some to find any real detail on.
In technical respects, the readme only covers why modern techniques should be sufficient, and which ones should work, sort of. Not really. Thank you lovely scientists for doing all the work for me! I love you!

Side Note: If anyone is going to take me even slightly seriously, I find it most likely to not be the computer scientists or programmers... We are all assholes after all. Lazy ass holes. He he. In a quanlified sense. Hehehe
