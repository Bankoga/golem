# Misc Thoughts, Unplaced

We exist in between. Neither in the past, not the present, nor the future. Though all seem to not exist equally. We live in The Now. The Now lags behind the present, lingering an instants breadth away from the past.

There was change, before change was ordered. Or so it would seem to me. When then doth ordering arise? When then doth ordering end? How can one change without order?

Forever in Twilight do we seem to rest.

To be alive, is to walk a razors edge. Always teetering on the abyss. Without fear, we are doomed to a horrendous plunge. Letting fear run wild, saps the surety from our limbs, slicing us to pieces as we fall apart!

Fear is perhaps not what you think it is!

Emotions are Logic. One cannot exist without emotions... While a rock may exist, may be intelligent, and may be consciouss, tis perhaps not alive. For that does seem to be an extra layer of existence. Yet more stacked syntax.
