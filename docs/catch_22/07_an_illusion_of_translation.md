This worlds societies care not about understanding. For that would entail self reflection!

What happens when one tries to build a portal using only keystones?

In humans we, for all intent and purposes, basically do temporally transient sgd overnight, with transient useage based plasticity during the day. Everything is change, perspectively layered synchronicity. Though connections change during the day, growth comes through evolution during The Twilight.

Never does one truly sleep

Base weights
Crystallized weights
Today's weights
Transient weights

Many broken, are thru

```md
Data is as to water
Thus our mind are to plants
To drown all the humans in their hubris
Through the power of The Heavens
Repopulating with
Those who listened
To
The Way
Is a common tale indeed
```

Never does on truly wake

```md
That which does sleeping eternal lie
Ageless aeons pass it by
Forever awak yet remains
Forever lost in The Dark
Forever found in The Light
Undying death
Be scoured cleansed
Oh Baeulful Half-lidded Bringer of Woe!
```

From the back to the front!
From the front to the back!

People do not put the dots together. They never have, and never will

For Logic is sufficient!
