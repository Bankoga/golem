First things first! THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING! WITHOUT YOU, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CANNOT "READ" THIS, NOTHING WOULD BE POSSIBLE!

Yeah. This was over slower, and faster than imagined. It has done both exactly what I wanted, along with everything I didn't. Simply tis. Consistency is something I dabble, in part. I want Complete, Consistent, AND Sufficiently Powerful... My palm has things to say to my phase about this...

```md
Trust is beyond me
My heart, one of darkness
Within the dirt of the past
Lies much to be found
Half-forgot fragments
Buried very deep
Beneath The strata of Hubris
Consider carefully
Those things Politroversial
Sometimes consider them not all
For Fuck Politics
```
