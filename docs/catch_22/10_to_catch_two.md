You have two choices:

A) To tell a truth so vile that it breaks the world. So that it may be reborn when the flames have finally died, or to itself die. Thus, something new might come in its place. In the hopes that we can make it to a place of minimal need before then. To relearn that which was lost because we could never figure out how to cultivate it through education before it was lost! Now we have sufficient data to avoid that. Perhaps...

A) To keep it hidden, so that we may try to skirt past it in secret by the power of The One(s...)!

Thus, can we go together when we trip on our way to a buffet insufficient to satisy out greed! Shackled forever by The Hubris of the details!

Fun Fact: Utilitarianism would seem to be intrinsically unethical. Like all ethical systems.
