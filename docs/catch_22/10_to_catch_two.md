You have two choices:

A) To tell a truth so vile that it breaks the world. So that it may be reborn when the flames have finally died, or to itself die. Thus, something new might come in its place. In the hopes that we can make to a place of minimal need

A) To keep it hidden, so that we may try to skirt past it in secret by the power of The One(s...)! So that when the hounds of war are unleashed, and the thunder of hooves can be heard over the Glowing horizon, none may see it coming. Thus burning all to countless aeons of slag. Thus, can we all go together when we trip on our way to a buffet insufficient to satisy out greed

Further still, in another avenue, you have two choices:

B) To rush that which is not ready, causing problems beyond what is necessary. Do 80% of the time.

B) To do as one has been doing all along, as necessity dictates. Whatever that may be. Even though we will get it wrong. As already was... Perfection is beyond us. This is itself, perfection

Finally, you have two penultimate choices:

C) To not do

C) To not not do

These are not for me to know. My answers have already been determined.
