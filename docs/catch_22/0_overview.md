Catch-22: Overview of an Anthological Pedestal
"Yadda yadda. The end is nigh! Yet another idiot doomspeaker..."

As the culmination of a lifetime of philosophical research, and 2 years of intensive dedicated research, I believe I am in the final run up to a fully operational generally inteligent software system, the endgame so to speak. The timing of this couldn't be more hilarious, for so many different cultural reasons. Coincidence, I have found, never was, merely lacking perspective. While like all things, this is a process, the destination is in plain sight. There are briars, brambles, and a few hills in between certaintly. However there are no ideological hurdles to be overcome any longer. Consequently, as part of finalizing my research, this series will serve as an introduction to some of the discoveries (mostly re-) that have been made along the way, and have ultimately led me here. hehe.

Each topic will be no more than a handful of thoughts on a broad, and pertinent subject coupled with a TL;DR like tag line. The initial post violates the aforementioned rule as it was intended as a one-off; only after did I realize that there were many concepts from my research to be broken out into digestible blurbs. Today in fact! Mostly I'm a ~~hot~~ mess. In this case, a handful consists of between 1 and 10 paragraphs worth of words in count, not form. Ideally, the average should be less than 2 paragraphs worth. These are simple things. We make them more complex than they need to be. Difficult certainly. Simple nonetheless they remain.

Appearing here, in no particular order, outside of that which they were thought up, lie the current shadows of future posts. To be updated with links to the actual posts, with timestamps, as they are made.

NOTE: All things are subject to change. It is beyond my capability to determine how this has all taken shape, or will take shape; my choices my carry along with whatever that entails. Logic has guided me here, and logic will carry me the rest of the way. In logic do I believe.

PS: If any one asks, no one I'm not a hermit who lives in a cave. Caves, unfortunately, don't have accessible internet at my price point... Somehow, working real time general intelligence is going to be cheaper. This is the most fucked up aspect of the entire situation to me.
