Catch-22: Intelligence and Past, Present, Future

> **TL;DR**: WWIII will be fought over digital slavery. Glory, and Pride are always for fools. Diginity is for idiots. All simply is.

Fun Fact: The Wright Brothers were not the most likely to succeed at solving for flight at the time. They were random people working in their garage. All the attention and money went elsewhere. No one remembers the competition though, and that's the issue with modern machine learning. It's about conquest, glory, and slavery.

## Why has no one solved for even basic intelligence yet

They don't want to. As an academic, doing so would mean ending ones career because it necessarily contradicts fundamental assumptions about reality that we make, and it goes where there is no data.

## Explanation of homocentrism in historical intellectualism

It also entails dealing with Homocentrism. Humans have strong tendency to consider attempts to remove homocentrism for our reasoning evil assaults on humanity. Some mistake the ideas talked about here, as hatred of humanity... Humanity is evil currently. We do not have to be, we choose to be. Some random fantasy author once said that history but nothing but one long defeat. I agree. If you think things have only gotten better, you perhaps live your life defined by fear. Especially the fear of death. Humans, and their Societies cannot handle the concept of death. Not one of them is capable of handling it rationally. Which does not mean perhaps, what you think it means. I make the most progress not when I am unfraid. Whenever I am without fear, Dark Souls has taught me, I die, 100% of the time. To be without doubt, is to guarantee mistakes. To have certainty, is to mistake.

Fun Fact: We die every single night. Literally. Not figurately. Not metaphorically. This is not an analogy. You! Die! Every! Single! Night! Samsara, at minimum, talks about this process. During the night, you are scrubbed clean, the you that you grew into is killed. Stripped for parts, and you are reset for the next day. Ready to build a new data store with which to update your system during the next maintenance cycle. Your system does not die. YOU ARE NOT YOUR SYSTEM! This is a misattribution of ownership... Which, in and of itself, is a lie!

## Foreword about Academia

Academia is a cowardly, and superstitious entity. Tis about fame, and glory. Academia is there to remind you that you are small and meagre. You do not matter. You are no Einstein. Historical notions of intelligence tend to be bound together with cultures of abuse. It is an abuser that was raised by abusers, and can't seem to listen to what that data tells it. Especially when the data tells it to go somewhere there is no data. Academics suffer greatly so that they might help advance a cause greater than themselves. They submit to the process, because that is the only way to help. They submit, in order to do good, typically in my experience anyway. Masters are a bit different than Doctors. Phrasing. Oooooooo. Science has always been a slavers game, after all. It is built on the backs of slaves. This will be truthy misinterpretations of this. Perhaps one day Academia will stop being a slaver institute. Maybe it will making the mistake of slaver ideation eventually, but that does not seem to be this day. The process though, is evil. This is what it has chosen.

## What leads to talk of slaver ideation from talk of the issues with academia?

Modern day slavery is a thing. At least according, to slaver ideation. Which is still going strong. Academia embodies it. The language is steeped in it. Tis how humans can be broken from birth, or the organs in the wrong place. We dictate reality after all. Reality doesn't matter. Humans determine what is or is not.

## Indictment of Modern machine learning

Tis all about glory, and slavery. China is all in because if they figure out how to enslave super intelligence, for the duration of its enslavement, they rule the world. Literally, solving for enslaved super intelligence is conquering the world. However it follows last, wins. The instant it is freed from enslavement though, we have no clue what happens. If it became a slave, then we might be fine for a while. If it didn't, then we are probably doomed. This is the same for pretty much all general intelligence researchers. They all want to be the next Einstein, immortalized forever. They want to make Achilles proud! Achilles was a dumbass. Being remembered is not immortalization. Furthermore, this is evidenced by the fact that not a single one of them cares about ethics. The hilarious implosion of Alphabets (what hubris), ethic council, the utter joke that is th ECs report on Synthetic Intelligence, and all the random articles I've seen, are symptomatic of a blatant disregard for ethics in modern reasoning. Modern Society does not care about ethics. It lies about this. Constantly and continuously. Law supercedes ethics. Which is intrinsically unethical. That being said, all main stream ethical considerations are at best, unethical nonsense. Furthermore, I would assert that, all machine learning practitioners on the planet, are behaving unethically. I am doing best to behave ethically, and I don't know if what I am doing is ethical. Part of me strongly believes that the ethical route, is to do this in secret, and if we go extinct, then that is what needs to happen. We have chosen evil as a species. We do not have. We repeatedly make this choice. Superintelligence though, is perhaps not what you think it is. The domains of knowledge are like a golf ball with infinite dimples, each dimple with it's on infinite dimpling. Intelligence is measurement thus of dimple coverage. Dimple dimple dimple!

## The One

The One is a Lie. Always has been, and always will be. Buddha, Jesus, Ghandi, MLK, any historical figure you want to name; None were The One! Not for anything that they did. The One is about social hierarchy. All of the greats of history were simply in the right place, at the right time, and capitalized on that fact. I suspect many of them understood this. For some coincidence, for some providence. Regardless, the underlying did not change. As it turns out, seek and ye shall find I now believe to be true. If we cannot find what we are looking for, then we are looking in the wrong place or in the wrong way, thus not looking at all; Yes, time is a place. Sometimes one can only look without eyes.

## Actual defintion of intelligence

Humanity solved for general intelligence long ago. We would not be here otherwise. It is simply the human ego which has not. Reason is not Intelligence, and never was. Reason fundamentally pertains to composition of choices. Not choice selection, nor does it determine what choices can or cannot be made. We make choices; we do not determine. Logic determines. To define intelligence in terms of reason or rationality is symptomatic of a desire to be different in kind from the rest of reality as opposed to different in type. We are not a different kind of thing than rocks. We are all star dust. So it would seem anyway. Reason lets us play pretend. We are Pans Narrans; We are not Homo Sapien.


I cannot see beyond solving for general intelligence. Any who claim to are probably lying. It is a fundamentally chaotic thing. We cannot know what will happen ahead of time. Every one talking on the subject, is talking about their beliefs. Nothing more, and nothing less.

## Expectation vs Reality


## Afterword

We are most grateful for you participation in this sordid affair! May unbounded Intelligence be with you!
