# Key

## Purpose

This document serves as an overview of all primary (paradigm) semantic, hierarchical, ontological cornerstone terms, and mappings.

> TODO: Have this document, or the connected actual document get generated as part of a dev build task!

## Paradigms to Concept Mappings

- Graph Paradigm: Matrix
  - Nodes/Vertices: Cells
  - Edges: Axons, Dendrites
  - Construction
  - Definition: Language, Documents, and Configs
  - Operation
  - Load/Save: File Type, Options, etc...
  - Resources: Neurotransmitter Types
- Learning Paradigm: Earth-based Organic Neurons
  - Activation: Non-linear combination of past 20 timesteps worth of synapse activity, and chemical concentration in the environment and within the cell
  - Cell Output: On/Off Spike
  - Connections: Synapses (axon-dendrite, dendrite-dendrite, axon-cell)
  - Connection Strengths: Num Synapses, Size per synapse
  - Updates: Neuromodulation, Neuroplasticity, Session Replay, ?
  - Value Types: Neurotransmitter Types
  - Neurotransmitter Types: Node Resources
- ML System Paradigm: Golem
  - Golem Overview
  - Construction
  - Configuration
  - Deployment
  - Maintenance
  - Modification
